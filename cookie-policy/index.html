  <h2>
What Are Cookies
  </h2>

  <p>
As is common practice with almost all websites this site uses cookies, which are small tag-like pieces of data that are downloaded to your computer to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or &#39;break&#39; certain elements of the sites functionality.

  <h2>
How We Use Cookies
  </h2>

  <p>
We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.
  </p>

  <h2>
Disabling Cookies
  </h2>

  <p>
You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.
  </p>

  <h2>
Cookies We Set
  </h2>

  <h3>
    _waive_session
  </h3>

  <p>
The _waive_session cookie is used to remember who you are when you are logged into Waive. This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit a new page. This cookie is removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.
  </p>

  <p>
This cookie is strictly required to use the Waive application.
  </p>

  <h3>
    _waive_cookie_banner
  </h3>

  <p>
The _waive_session cookie is used to remember whether you have consented to the use of cookies. Once set the cookie banner will be hidden.
  </p>

  <p>
This cookie is not strictly required to use the Waive application and can be avoided by not accepting the cookie banner.
  </p>

  <p>
Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren&#39;t sure whether you need or not it&#39;s usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.
